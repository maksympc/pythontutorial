# Fuctions and Methods

# sorted function
# Create lists first and second
first = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0]
second = [10.75, 9.50]

# Paste together first and second: full
full = first + second

# Sort full in descending order: full_sorted
full_sorted = sorted(full, reverse = True)

# Print out full_sorted
print(full_sorted)

# index and count methods
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Print out the index of the element 20.0
print(areas.index(20.0))

# Print out how often 14.5 appears in areas
print(areas.count(14.5))

# append and reverse methods
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Use append twice to add poolhouse and garage size
areas.append(24.5)
areas.append(15.45)

# Print out areas
print(areas)

# Reverse the orders of the elements in areas
areas.reverse()

# Print out areas
print(areas)
